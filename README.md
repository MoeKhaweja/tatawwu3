> A mobile app for finding volunteering oppurtunities based on skills, making it easier for volunteers and communities/organizations to connect.
>
> Tatawwu3 aims to simplify the process of volunteering by providing a user-friendly platform for volunteers to apply for opputunities, and for communities/organizations to find suitable volunteers.

### User Stories

  <h4>As a Volunteer:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>I want to be able to create my profile by uploading nessesary documents, so that I don't waste time on manually creating my profile.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to find oppurtunities based on my skill/experience, so that I can help with what I'm best at.</li>
    <li>I want to be able to chat with other volunteers in chat rooms, so that I can stay connected with people with similar interests.</li>
</ul>

<h4>As an Organization:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I want to be able to find volunteers efficiently, so that I can make sure my events run smoothly on time.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to add events and manage applicants, so that I can organize my events precisely.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to create chat rooms for my volunteers, so that I can leave a good impact on youth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>As an Admin:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I want to be able to approve or deny users registering for the app, so that I can verify their identities.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to monitor general information on a dashboard, so that I can keep track of app.
</li>
</ul>

### Tatawwu3 is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses [React](https://react.dev/) for the admin dashboard. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, it is used to build single-page applications, and it allows us to create reusable UI components.
- This project uses [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for the frontend. React Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) which is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing our deployments on the cloud.
- As a backend, the app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with [Express.js](https://nodejs.org/en), Express JS is a small framework that works on top of Node web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing.
- The app uses [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for real time chats, Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. 
- The app also relies heavily on [Google Gemini AI](https://ai.google.dev/docs) which is Google's largest and most capable AI model, in our app it is used to:
  <ul><li>Analyze every user's resume and return specific data based on prompt engineering</li> 
  <li>Recommend events for volunteers using vector embeddings</li> 
  <li>Allow users to search semantically over events or volunteers, based on skills or targeted skills using vector embeddings</li> </ul>
