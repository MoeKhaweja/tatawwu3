> A mobile app for finding volunteering oppurtunities based on skills, making it easier for volunteers and communities/organizations to connect.
>
> Tatawwu3 aims to simplify the process of volunteering by providing a user-friendly platform for volunteers to apply for opputunities, and for communities/organizations to find suitable volunteers.

### User Stories

  <h4>As a Volunteer:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>I want to be able to create my profile by uploading nessesary documents, so that I don't waste time on manually creating my profile.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to find oppurtunities based on my skill/experience, so that I can help with what I'm best at.</li>
    <li>I want to be able to chat with other volunteers in chat rooms, so that I can stay connected with people with similar interests.</li>
</ul>

<h4>As an Organization:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I want to be able to find volunteers efficiently, so that I can make sure my events run smoothly on time.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to add events and manage applicants, so that I can organize my events precisely.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to create chat rooms for my volunteers, so that I can leave a good impact on youth.</li>
</ul>
<h4>As an Admin:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I want to be able to approve or deny users registering for the app, so that I can verify their identities.</li>

### Tatawwu3 is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses [React](https://react.dev/) for the admin dashboard. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, it is used to build single-page applications, and it allows us to create reusable UI components.
- This project uses [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for the frontend. React Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) which is a fully-managed cloud database that handles all the complexity of deploying, managing, and healing our deployments on the cloud.
- As a backend, the app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with [Express.js](https://nodejs.org/en), Express JS is a small framework that works on top of Node web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing.
- The app uses [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for real time chats, Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. 
- The app also relies heavily on [Google Gemini AI](https://ai.google.dev/docs) which is Google's largest and most capable AI model, in our app it is used to:
  <ul><li>Analyze every user's resume and return specific data based on prompt engineering</li> 
  <li>Recommend events for volunteers using vector embeddings</li> 
  <li>Allow users to search semantically over events or volunteers, based on skills or targeted skills using vector embeddings</li> </ul>

> We designed Tatawwu3 using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<img src="./readme/title7.svg"/>

- Prompt engineering (with Google Generative AI) was used to generate a user biograpghy based on his resume, extract and return user skills and academic history.
  
#### Example:

>`pretend that you are a machine that analyzes people by only reading their CVs, you never generate something you don't know about them, I will provide you with a text of my CV, try to make a small (bio) about me , and extract the most important skills (skills should be titles or words )and extract academic history, return only a json object like this without any surrounding data {bio:{String},academicHistory:[{degreeTitle:String, Institution:String}],skills:[]}, keep in mind that skills are so important, be non biased: ${extracted}`

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title10.svg"/>

> To set up Tatawwu3 locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install NPM from: [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Install nodemon
   ```sh
   npm install nodemon
   ```
## Installation

### First, Cloning and Installing Packages

1. Clone the repository and then open it
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MohammadKhaweja/tatawwu3.git
   cd backend 
   ```
2. Create a .env file in backend and then:
   1. Create a [Google Gemini AI](https://ai.google.dev/docs) API Key 
   2. Create an Gmail account and then an [App Password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en)
   3. Create a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) Cluster 
   After that add them to the env file as follows:

    ```sh
    JWT_SECRET=yourSecret
    MONGODB_URL=yourClusterConnection
    GMAIL='yourGmail@gmail.com'
    PASSWORD='password'
    GEMINI_API='yourApi'

    ```
    4. cd frontend and go to store/user
       
    ```sh
    export const BASE_URL = "yuorLocalHost";

    ```
  
3. Install NPM packages for Backend, Frontend and Admin:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ..
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   cd admin
   npm install
   ```

### Second, let's start the server

 In `backend` run this command:
   ```sh
   nodemon 
   ```
### Third, let's start the frontend

 Open a new terminal and go to `frontend` and run this command:
   ```sh
   npx expo start 
   ```
### Lastly, let's start the Admin Dasboard
 Open a new terminal and go to `admin` and run this command:
   ```sh
   npm run dev 
   ```

Now, you should be able to run Tatawwu3 locally and explore its features.
